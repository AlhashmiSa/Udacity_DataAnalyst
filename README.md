# Udacity_DataAnalyst
 This is a project work I did for the **Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree**
 
 ## Project 1 - Global Weather Trends 
 In this project, I have analysed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends with where I live to overall global   temperatures
 
 * Extract the data from the database.
 * Created a line chart that compares my city’s temperatures with the global temperatures. I made sure to plot the moving average rather    than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable
 * Made observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends.
 
## My Inferences
 
a) Global temperatures are very less compared to Hyderabad and Delhi

b) The temperatures for all the 3 categories have increased marginally in the last 200 years of data

c) The lowest temperatures found for Global (7.3 deg C) around 1820, whereas for Hyderabad (25.8 deg C) around 1830. and for Delhi (26 deg Celcius) around 1820

d) Hyderabad temperature increment is more at present compared to Global and Delhi

e) Exactly 50 years from the year 1807, we observe that Global and Delhi have their temperatures dipped but for Hyderabad it is consistent.

f) The global temperature remained consistent until the year 1957, but after 1957 increased.
there seems to be a lot of change in temperatures . Hence global temperatures are 

g) At every 50 years interval, the temperatures are shown in chart , Hence we can observe that temperatures have changed by +/ -0.3

h) The correlation coefficient for (Global vs Delhi -> 0.937) and (Global vs Hyderabad -> 0.687) So from above, the changes in Global temperature will have huge impact to Delhi when compared to Hyderabad

i) The difference in 12 year MA temperatures for Global (0.89) , Hyderabad(1.16), Delhi (1.04)
(comparison done w.r.t 1807 vs 2013)
